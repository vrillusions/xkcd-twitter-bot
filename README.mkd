# XKCD Twitter Bot [![Project Status](http://stillmaintained.com/vrillusions/xkcd-twitter-bot.png)](http://stillmaintained.com/vrillusions/xkcd-twitter-bot) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vrillusions/xkcd-twitter-bot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vrillusions/xkcd-twitter-bot)

This is the code that reads the rss feed from xkcd and posts to [@xkcd_bot](http://twitter.com/xkcd_bot).

I made this when I noticed [@xkcdbot](http://twitter.com/xkcdbot) hasn't updated in a while.  Afterwards I realized there's [@xkcdrss](http://twitter.com/xkcdrss).  Still leaving this around since I spent an entire, like, hour doing this and may be useful for people that want to do their own twitter bot of some sort.

## Setup

- setup virtualenv if you haven't yet. I like [virtualenv-burrito](https://github.com/brainsik/virtualenv-burrito) to get up and going quick
- run `mkvirtualenv -r requirements.txt xkcd-twitter-bot`
- copy `config-sample.ini` to `config.ini`
- go to http://dev.twitter.com and create an app for yourself. Make sure it has read/write access
- put the app api keys (`consumer_key` and `consumer_secret`) in `config.ini`.
- run `get_user_credentials.py` which will get you the user api keys (or you can generate on website if app is registered to same user that's posting)
- put those values in `config.ini`
- run `update_twitter.py -v` and it may actually work
