# XKCD Twitter Bot

This is the code that reads the rss feed from xkcd and posts to [@xkcd_bot](http://twitter.com/xkcd_bot).

## Setup

Since twitter only allows oauth--even for automated posting by yourself--I had to create an app at http://dev.twitter.com.  They let you generate oauth credentials for your user, which is what I did.

## Requirements

* tweepy - which is included in package
* feedparser - not included so make sure it's installed
